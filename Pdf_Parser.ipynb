While these numbers are based on what the \\nCompany believes to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, \\nthere are inherent challenges in measuring across some operational metrics. The \\nmethodologies used to measure these metrics require considerable judgment and are also \\nsusceptible to an algorithm or other technical errors. The Company systematically reviews \\nits processes for calculating these metrics from time to time and may discover inaccuracies \\nin the metrics or may make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in \\nadjustments to previously disclosed metrics. In addition, the Company metrics may differ \\nfrom estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology. \\nTo facilitate understanding, some non-GAAP metrics are used  and financial amounts are \\nconverted from ₹ Lakhs into ₹ Crores for this Presentation hence, there could be some \\ntotalling anomalies in the numbers.\\n\\n\\n--- Page 3 ---\\nTracxn Overview\\nTracxn is a Data & Software platform \\nfor the Private Markets globally\\nWe work with Venture Capital Firms, Private \\nEquity Firms, Investment Banks - as well as M&A \\n& Innovation teams of large Corporates\\nGlobal Platform, customers span 50+ countries\\n\\n\\n--- Page 4 ---\\nQ1 FY24 Financial Performance\\n\\n\\n--- Page 5 ---\\nPAT Margin\\n3.5 %\\n   \\nEBITDA Margin\\n0.1%\\n   \\nPAT\\n0.7 Cr.\\n    \\nRevenue from Operations\\n19.8 Cr.\\nEBITDA\\n \\n0.02 Cr.\\n   \\nFree Cash Flow2\\n0.6 Cr.\\n \\nCash & Cash Equivalents1\\n61.9 Cr.\\nTotal Income\\n20.8 Cr.\\nIn INR\\n0.17 Cr.
