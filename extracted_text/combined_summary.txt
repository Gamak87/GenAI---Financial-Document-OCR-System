susceptible to an algorithm or other technical errors. The Company systematically reviews 
its processes for calculating these metrics from time to time and may discover inaccuracies 
in the metrics or may make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in 
adjustments to previously disclosed metrics. In addition, the Company metrics may differ 
from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology. 
To facilitate understanding, some non-GAAP metrics are used  and financial amounts are 
converted from ₹ Lakhs into ₹ Crores for this Presentation hence, there could be some 
totalling anomalies in the numbers.

1. Expanding coverage of Company Financials & Captables 
●Currently cover private company financials across 15+ countries and captables 
across 10+ countries
●Seeing demand for this data - especially from Private Equity (PE) and 
Investment Banking (IB) segments among others
●For illustration - An investor is looking to scan an upcoming space like “single 
speciality hospital chain” or “D2C , Internet-first brands” in a particular country, 
and in addition to interesting companies, market landscape, also those with 
>50Cr. revenue scale
●Hence, increasing coverage of these datasets. Bulk of the increments required 
for this (eg. team size increase) is already done 
●We believe this will help us accelerate revenue growth and increase our 
penetration within the customer segments especially PE & IB
